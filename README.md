## Introduction
The cost of housing is an important factor in people's lives, affecting their financial well-being, quality of life, and overall happiness. This project aims to analyze various aspects of housing affordability in the US using a dataset that includes information on income, housing costs, building age, and geographic location.

## Background
For many Americans, the rising expense of housing, particularly in urban areas, is becoming a serious problem. Finding affordable housing options has become more difficult for individuals and families in recent years as housing costs have surpassed wage growth. The goal of this study is to understand the fundamental causes of this pattern that can help policy make make informed decisions. 

## Methodology
The project begins with the collection and preprocessing of data using a data-driven methodology. Relevant characteristics are extracted or altered, missing values are handled, and the dataset is cleaned. Next, in order to learn more about trends in housing affordability, exploratory data analysis approaches are used, such as statistical analysis and data visualization. Ultimately, the results are examined and evaluated. 

## Results
The analysis reveals several key findings, including the correlation between income and housing costs, the impact of building age on housing value, and regional variations in housing affordability. Visualizations such as scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps are used to illustrate these findings effectively.

## Discussion
The results of the analysis shed light on the complex nature of housing affordability in the US. Factors such as income levels, housing costs, and regional disparities play significant roles in determining the affordability of housing. By employing data analysis techniques and visualization tools, this project provides valuable insights into the underlying trends and challenges facing individuals and communities in accessing affordable housing.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project highlights the importance of understanding and addressing housing affordability issues in the US. By leveraging data-driven approaches and analytical tools, we can better understand the factors contributing to housing affordability challenges and develop strategies to promote access to affordable housing for all.
